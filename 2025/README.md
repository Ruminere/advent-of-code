# AoC 2025
Another year, another Advent of Code! Except that I injured my wrist this year, so I'm doing the problems later in the month and into the new year. And [the leaderboard is going offline](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about#faq_leaderboard), so there's not really much competiton to be found anyway.

I'm currently learning cybersecurity, so I'm going to do all these challenges in C. These solutions will all correspond to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## Usage
Simply go to every folder and run `make`. To delete the output file, run `make clear`.

## Extras
Hall of Shame TBD.

# Problem 03

*December 31, 2025*

So, so ugly, and only because of some bound errors (coming up with `i <= len-includenum+j` took a lot of sweat and tears). Got to be careful with this one.

I noticed that the answer for part 1 could be generalized to the answer for part 2, so I copied and pasted the code and played around with it a bit. Using the same function to aid with testing saved me a lot of time.

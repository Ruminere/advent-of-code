Ah yes. I completely forgot about the [lanternfish problem](../../2021/Problem06/) until I saw part 2, so I implemented [main_naive.py](main_naive.py) for part 1. As such, part 2 involved me converting my code so that it solved the problem the "smart" way and berating myself for not realizing sooner. We love to see it.

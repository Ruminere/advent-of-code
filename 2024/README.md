# AoC 2024
Another year, another Advent of Code! I repurposed the current repo so that I could use it for 2024 as well (originally, I was just going to create a new repo).

Once again, these were my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). I kept my solutions the way I had them when submitting the output, so some code may be messy (or quite inefficient, or specific to my input).

As of November 24, 2024, I am planning on working on the `aoctools` package again; specifically, the module that would allow me to automatically fetch the solutions from the internet (`aoc_web.py`).

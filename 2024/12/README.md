I skipped out on Days 6 and 7 since I had a ton of projects due yesterday (Dec 6) and I haven't been feeling well recently—I spent the majority of today sleeping (AoC starts at 23:00 for me since my timezone is CST). I'll probably look at them tomorrow. [I finished all three of my projects](../05/README.md), though—which I wasn't expecting, considering I procrastinated so much I was expecting to turn my Cache Lab project in late!

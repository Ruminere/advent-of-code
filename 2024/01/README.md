Another year, another Advent of Code! I repurposed this current repo so that I could use it for 2024 as well (originally, I was just going to create a new repo).

I ABSOLUTELY outdid myself from [last year](/2023/01/README.md). I literally cheered when I saw that I got rank 429 for part 1. I'm so proud of myselfâ€”I didn't know that I could go that fast.

I choked while doing part 2 since I misread it and thought that the numbers in the set in the left were non-repeating, so I wasted literal minutes attempting to debug that before deciding to run the test input, realizing that I had probably misinterpreted the question, and reading the problem again. I also did not know about the `list.count()` function, so I manually iterated. Oh well, stuff happens.

Excited for part 2!

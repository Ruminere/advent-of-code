# Advent of Code Repo
All my solutions to each of the AoC questions I've done, as well as my unfiltered thoughts on each of them! (Yes it's slightly embarrassing, but whatever.)

I did [2021](/2021/), [2023](/2023/), and [2024](/2024/) mostly during the month, while I did every other year afterwards. (I didn't do 2022 the year of due to college apps.) As such, I probably have more *interesting* rants about them!
